## Database and ERD

![Database ERD](database_erd.png)

The database will hold match-ups of teams and their starting pitchers. These match-ups will link to correlating stats for the pitcher and the batters of the team they are playing against.

The database will hold pitcher stats earned runs average (ERA), walks plus hits per innings pitchers (WHIP), and strikeout rate. These stats correspond with the batter stats of runs per game, walks plus hits per innings batted (WHIB), and strikeout rate.
